Heroku runs your apps by executing the main command in your Procfile. This is often a command to start a web server.

These commands are executed in dynos â€” isolated, lightweight, share-nothing, Linux containers.

To scale a web app, you can start more dynos that run the web server.

Heroku's routers automatically direct traffic across all web dynos randomly, and the Dyno Manager keeps your dynos running.
